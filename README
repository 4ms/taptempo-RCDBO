Tap Tempo RCD Breakout
version 1.0

Uses a clocker PCB to be an active RCD Breakout. A tap tempo button is wired to the board, as well as a three-position switch for tap tempo mode. 

Six flip switches are also wired to the board, which outputs the appropriate gates to the breakout header (that connects to a standard RCD). The flip swithes can be jacks as well.

Circuit diagram will be released at some point in the future...
